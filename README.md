executor/src/database.rs: Handles all interactions with the SQLite trade database. Logs attempts, opens trades, and updates PnL.

executor/src/executor.rs: Contains the MasterExecutor logic. Manages strategy lifecycle, dispatches market events, and executes trades (calls Jupiter/Signer/Jito).

executor/src/jupiter.rs: Integrates with the Jupiter Aggregator API for optimal swap quotes and transaction building.

✅ Core Features of v17-Pro (Patched)

All Critical Patches Applied: Addresses 8 key vulnerabilities and inefficiencies identified in previous versions, including Jupiter URL typos, SOL price accuracy, slippage, Jito integration, Redis Pub/Sub reliability, and portfolio stop-loss.

Multi-Strategy Orchestration: Runs a portfolio of distinct trading strategies concurrently.

10 Fully Implemented Strategies: A diverse set of 10 orthogonal strategies are implemented with working logic.

Dynamic, Risk-Adjusted Capital Allocation: The meta_allocator service uses Sharpe Ratio to dynamically assign capital to the most efficient, risk-adjusted strategies.

High-Fidelity Event Streams: The system processes specialized data streams for Bridge Events, Market Depth, and Funding Rates, allowing strategies to trade on direct, high-alpha signals.

Hyper-Efficient Event Routing: The executor uses a subscription model. Strategies only receive the specific data events they need.

Institutional-Grade Security: A dedicated, isolated signer service is the only component with access to the private key.

Robust Portfolio Stop-Loss (P-6): A new portfolio_monitor actively tracks overall portfolio drawdown and can pause trading to prevent ruin.

Redis Streams for Reliability (P-7): All critical inter-service communication now uses Redis Streams, ensuring message persistence and guaranteed delivery even if consumers restart.

Out-of-the-Box Simulation: The strategy_factory and data_consumers include data simulators for comprehensive paper testing.

Comprehensive "Glass Cockpit" Dashboard: The dashboard displays per-strategy performance, including PnL, trade counts, and the calculated Sharpe Ratio, alongside live capital allocations.

🏗️ System Architecture & Services Overview

The system is composed of several independent microservices that communicate via a Redis event bus.

Service	Language	Core Responsibility
strategy_factory	Python	The R&D Dept. Discovers/creates strategy "blueprints" (StrategySpec) and publishes them to the registry. Includes a data simulator for testing.
meta_allocator	Rust	The Portfolio Manager. Reads all available strategies, analyzes their performance (PnL, Sharpe), and publishes capital StrategyAllocation commands.
executor	Rust	The Operations Floor. Listens for allocations, spins up strategy engines, routes market data to them, and processes their buy/sell signals.
signer	Rust	The Vault. A minimal, highly-secure service whose only job is to sign transactions. It has zero trading logic and is the only service with private key access.
data_consumers	Python	The Sensors. Collects high-fidelity market data (price, social, depth, bridge, funding) and publishes it to Redis Streams. (Currently simulated for out-of-box testing).
dashboard	Python	The Cockpit. Provides a real-time web interface to monitor the entire system, view allocations, and track performance.

🔧 Operational Guide
1. Deployment

Deployment is handled by a single script after initial setup.

Create Wallets:

Create a main trading wallet (my_wallet.json). Fund it with SOL.

Create a separate, non-funded wallet for Jito authentication (jito_auth_key.json).

Place both files in the project root.

Configure Environment:

Copy .env.example to .env.

Fill in all required API keys and verify wallet filenames.

Deploy to GCP:

Make the deployment script executable: chmod +x ./scripts/deploy_vm_gcp.sh

Run the script: ./scripts/deploy_vm_gcp.sh

2. Post-Deployment Health Checks

After deploying, verify that the system is running correctly:

Generated bash
# Check that all Docker containers are up and healthy
gcloud compute ssh meme-snipe-v17-vm --command='cd /opt/meme-snipe-v17-pro && docker-compose ps'

# Check the strategy registry to ensure the factory is working
gcloud compute ssh meme-snipe-v17-vm --command='docker exec -it meme-snipe-v17-pro-redis-1 redis-cli scard strategy_registry'
# Expected output: 10 (or more if you add custom strategies)

# Check the active allocations to ensure the allocator is working
gcloud compute ssh meme-snipe-v17-vm --command='docker exec -it meme-snipe-v17-pro-redis-1 redis-cli get active_allocations'
# Expected output: A JSON array of allocations

# View the logs of the core services
gcloud compute ssh meme-snipe-v17-vm --command='cd /opt/meme-snipe-v17-pro && docker-compose logs -f executor meta_allocator strategy_factory'

3. Switching to Live Data

The system defaults to using the built-in data simulator. To switch to real-world data feeds:

Implement Real Data Consumers: Replace the placeholder logic in data_consumers/*.py with actual API integrations (e.g., Helius LaserStream for price/depth, Twitter/Telegram APIs for social, Helius webhooks for on-chain/bridge events, Drift API for funding rates).

Configure API Keys: Ensure your .env file has all necessary API keys for these live data sources.

Disable Simulator: In strategy_factory/factory.py, comment out the "Data Simulation Loop" section.

Redeploy: Run the deployment script again to apply the changes.

💻 Strategy Development Guide (SDK)

This system is designed for rapid development of new alpha.

The Contract (Strategy Trait): Every strategy is a Rust struct that implements the Strategy trait defined in executor/src/strategies/mod.rs. This trait requires:

id(&self) -> &'static str: Unique identifier.

subscriptions(&self) -> HashSet<EventType>: Crucial. Declares which MarketEvent types (Price, Social, Depth, Bridge, Funding, OnChain) the strategy needs. The executor will only send these events to your strategy.

init(&mut self, params: &Value) -> Result<()>: Initializes the strategy with its unique parameters from the spec.

on_event(&mut self, event: &MarketEvent) -> Result<StrategyAction>: The core logic loop, called for every relevant market event.

The Blueprint (docs/STRATEGY_TEMPLATE.md): Before writing any code, copy this template. It forces you to define your strategy's thesis, data requirements, parameters, and risks. It is a mandatory part of any new strategy submission.

The Workflow:

Document: Create your strategy's documentation by filling out the template.

Implement: Create a new file in executor/src/strategies/. Implement the Strategy trait according to your design document.

Register: Use the register_strategy! macro in your file to make the executor aware of your new engine.

Configure: Add default parameters for your new strategy in strategy_factory/factory.py.

Test: Add a unit test for your strategy's logic.

Deploy: Run docker-compose up --build. The system will automatically discover, allocate to, and run your new strategy.

💰 Cost Management

Operating this system incurs costs from multiple sources. Be vigilant in monitoring them.

GCP VM: The e2-standard-4 machine type costs approximately $70-100/month.

Data Providers: Helius, Pyth, Twitter, Telegram, Drift, etc. Costs vary significantly based on usage and tier. Monitor your provider dashboards closely.

AI Services (Grok/OpenAI): If you integrate an AI-based strategy, API calls can be expensive. Implement cost tracking and daily limits.

Jito Tips: These are direct costs per transaction. The system is designed to pay adaptive tips, but high trading volume will lead to higher tip costs.

Recommendation: Set up billing alerts in your GCP account and monitor all API provider dashboards daily.

⚠️ CRITICAL WARNING & DISCLAIMER

This is professional-grade, high-risk software. Its complexity and autonomy create significant risks alongside its potential advantages. Misconfiguration, bugs, or volatile market conditions can lead to rapid and total financial loss.

This is not financial advice. This software is a tool for executing trading strategies. The strategies provided are for educational and illustrative purposes only and are not guaranteed to be profitable.

DO NOT RUN WITH REAL MONEY until you have run the system in PAPER_TRADING_MODE for an extended period and fully understand its behavior and the risks of each individual strategy.

YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE for the security of your API keys and wallet files. The use of a dedicated, isolated signer service is a security best practice, but it does not eliminate all risks.

THE STRATEGIES ARE NOT INFALLIBLE. They are based on statistical probabilities, not certainties. They can and will have losing trades. Past performance is not indicative of future results.

YOU ARE THE PORTFOLIO MANAGER. The ultimate responsibility for monitoring the system, managing risk, and disabling it if it behaves unexpectedly rests with you.
