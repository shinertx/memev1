üöÄ MemeSnipe v16 - "Alpha Synthesis" Edition

An institutional-grade, multi-strategy framework for autonomous memecoin trading on Solana.

This is a complete, end-to-end system designed for the discovery, analysis, and execution of a diverse portfolio of trading strategies. It is built on a secure, high-performance, event-driven architecture that allows for hot-swappable trading algorithms.

This is not a simple trading bot; it is a platform for developing, testing, and deploying alpha.

‚úÖ Core Features of v16

Multi-Strategy Orchestration: The system runs a portfolio of distinct trading strategies concurrently. It is not reliant on a single source of alpha.

10 Fully Implemented Strategies: A diverse set of 10 orthogonal strategies are fully implemented with working logic, covering momentum, mean reversion, social sentiment, on-chain events, and more.

Dynamic Capital Allocation: A meta_allocator service dynamically assigns capital to the most profitable strategies based on their real-time performance (PnL, Sharpe Ratio).

Event-Driven for Peak Performance: A sophisticated executor routes high-speed data streams (price ticks, social mentions) to only the strategies that need them, ensuring maximum efficiency.

Institutional-Grade Security: A dedicated, isolated signer service is the only component with access to the private key. The main trading logic runs without direct key access, dramatically reducing attack surface.

Strategy SDK & Hot-Swapping: A professional framework allows developers to build, test, and deploy new strategies by simply adding a new file and adhering to a strict Strategy trait, without ever stopping the core system.

Out-of-the-Box Simulation: The strategy_factory includes a data simulator that publishes realistic market data, allowing the entire system to be tested and validated out-of-the-box.

Comprehensive "Glass Cockpit" Dashboard: A rich, real-time interface provides a complete overview of the entire strategy portfolio, including live allocations, performance metrics for each engine, and a detailed trade history.

üèóÔ∏è System Architecture & Services Overview

The system is composed of several independent microservices that communicate via a Redis event bus.

Service	Language	Core Responsibility
strategy_factory	Python	The R&D Dept. Discovers/creates strategy "blueprints" (StrategySpec) and publishes them to the registry. Includes a data simulator for testing.
meta_allocator	Rust	The Portfolio Manager. Reads all available strategies, analyzes their performance (PnL, Sharpe), and publishes capital StrategyAllocation commands.
executor	Rust	The Operations Floor. Listens for allocations, spins up strategy engines, routes market data to them, and processes their buy/sell signals.
signer	Rust	The Vault. A minimal, highly-secure service whose only job is to sign transactions. It has zero trading logic and is the only service with private key access.
dashboard	Python	The Cockpit. Provides a real-time web interface to monitor the entire system, view allocations, and track performance.

üîß Operational Guide
1. Deployment

Deployment is handled by a single script after initial setup.

Create Wallets:

Create a main trading wallet (my_wallet.json). Fund it with SOL.

Create a separate, non-funded wallet for Jito authentication (jito_auth_key.json).

Place both files in the project root.

Configure Environment:

Copy .env.example to .env.

Fill in all required API keys and verify wallet filenames.

Deploy to GCP:

Make the deployment script executable: chmod +x ./scripts/deploy_vm_gcp.sh

Run the script: ./scripts/deploy_vm_gcp.sh

2. Post-Deployment Health Checks

After deploying, verify that the system is running correctly:

Generated bash
# Check that all Docker containers are up and healthy
gcloud compute ssh meme-snipe-v16-vm --command='cd /opt/meme-snipe-v16 && docker-compose ps'

# Check the strategy registry to ensure the factory is working
gcloud compute ssh meme-snipe-v16-vm --command='docker exec -it meme-snipe-v16-redis-1 redis-cli scard strategy_registry'
# Expected output: 10

# Check the active allocations to ensure the allocator is working
gcloud compute ssh meme-snipe-v16-vm --command='docker exec -it meme-snipe-v16-redis-1 redis-cli get active_allocations'
# Expected output: A JSON array of allocations

# View the logs of the core services
gcloud compute ssh meme-snipe-v16-vm --command='cd /opt/meme-snipe-v16 && docker-compose logs -f executor meta_allocator'

3. Switching to Live Data

The system defaults to using the built-in data simulator. To switch to real-world data feeds (like the Helius webhook receiver from v14):

Enable the Service: In docker-compose.yml, uncomment or add the webhook_receiver and brain services.

Disable the Simulator: In strategy_factory/factory.py, comment out the "Data Simulation Loop" section.

Update Data Sources: Modify the executor's main.rs to subscribe to the real Redis channels populated by the live data services instead of the simulation channels.

Redeploy: Run the deployment script again to apply the changes.

üíª Strategy Development Guide (SDK)

This system is designed for rapid development of new alpha.

The Contract (Strategy Trait): Every strategy is a Rust struct that implements the Strategy trait defined in executor/src/strategies/mod.rs. This trait requires two main functions:

init(&mut self, params: &Value) -> Result<()>: Initializes the strategy with its unique parameters from the spec.

on_event(&mut self, event: &MarketEvent) -> Result<StrategyAction>: The core logic loop, called for every relevant market event.

The Blueprint (STRATEGY_TEMPLATE.md): Before writing any code, copy docs/STRATEGY_TEMPLATE.md. This document forces you to define your strategy's thesis, data requirements, parameters, and risks. It is a mandatory part of any new strategy submission.

The Workflow:

Document: Create your strategy's documentation by filling out the template.

Implement: Create a new file in executor/src/strategies/. Implement the Strategy trait according to your design document.

Register: Use the register_strategy! macro in your file to make the executor aware of your new engine.

Configure: Add default parameters for your new strategy in strategy_factory/factory.py.

Test: Add a unit test for your strategy's logic.

Deploy: Run docker-compose up --build. The system will automatically discover, allocate to, and run your new strategy.

üí∞ Cost Management

Operating this system incurs costs from multiple sources. Be vigilant in monitoring them.

GCP VM: The e2-standard-4 machine type costs approximately $70-100/month.

Helius: RPC usage and Webhooks (if using live data) have costs based on usage. Monitor your Helius dashboard closely.

AI Services (Grok/OpenAI): If you integrate an AI-based strategy, API calls can be expensive. Implement cost tracking and daily limits.

Data Feeds: If you subscribe to premium real-time data feeds, these will have their own costs.

Recommendation: Set up billing alerts in your GCP account and monitor your API provider dashboards daily.

‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL WARNING & DISCLAIMER

This is professional-grade, high-risk software. Its complexity and autonomy create significant risks alongside its potential advantages. Misconfiguration, bugs, or volatile market conditions can lead to rapid and total financial loss.

This is not financial advice. This software is a tool for executing trading strategies. The strategies provided are for educational and illustrative purposes only and are not guaranteed to be profitable.

DO NOT RUN WITH REAL MONEY until you have run the system in PAPER_TRADING_MODE for an extended period and fully understand its behavior and the risks of each individual strategy.

YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE for the security of your API keys and wallet files. The use of a dedicated, isolated signer service is a security best practice, but it does not eliminate all risks.

THE STRATEGIES ARE NOT INFALLIBLE. They are based on statistical probabilities, not certainties. They can and will have losing trades. Past performance is not indicative of future results.

YOU ARE THE PORTFOLIO MANAGER. The ultimate responsibility for monitoring the system, managing risk, and disabling it if it behaves unexpectedly rests with you.
